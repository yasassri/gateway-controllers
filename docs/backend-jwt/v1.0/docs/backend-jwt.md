# Backend JWT

Generates a signed JWT containing authenticated user information and injects it into the upstream request header. Run this policy **after** an authentication policy (e.g. `jwt-auth`, `basic-auth`, `api-key-auth`) to forward a gateway-signed assertion to backend services.

Backend services can verify the generated JWT using the gateway's corresponding public key — they do not need access to the original client credential (API key, OAuth token, etc.).

## How It Works

1. After an auth policy authenticates the request, the gateway's `AuthContext` is populated with the subject, auth type, issuer, audience, scopes, and any custom properties from the incoming credential.
2. The Backend JWT policy reads this context, builds a JWT with the configured claims, and signs it with the configured RSA or ECDSA private key.
3. The signed JWT is set as the value of the configured upstream header (default: `x-jwt-assertion`).
4. The upstream service verifies the JWT using the matching public key.

When the incoming credential is a JWT (authenticated by `jwt-auth`), all non-standard claims from the original token are automatically forwarded to the backend JWT under their original names. Standard claims (`iss`, `aud`, `sub`, etc.) are handled via their dedicated typed fields (see table below). Scopes are forwarded as a space-delimited `scope` claim. `claimMappings` and `customClaims` can add aliases or override any auto-forwarded claim.

Generated tokens are cached in memory for half their configured `tokenExpiry` (minimum 30 seconds). The cache key is derived from the authenticated client identity, API operation path, and all resolved claim values. Requests from the same client hitting the same operation within the cache window receive the previously signed token, avoiding repeated cryptographic operations. Dynamic custom claims that differ between requests (e.g. `$ctx:request.header.*`) produce separate cache entries, preserving correctness.

If no authentication context is present (no auth policy in the chain), a backend JWT is still generated using the available system claims (`iss`, `iat`, `exp`). Auth-derived claims (`sub`, `auth_type`, `original_iss`, `aud`, `credential_id`) are omitted. Static `customClaims` and request-context variables (`$ctx:request.*`, `$ctx:api.*`) still resolve normally. To enforce that authentication must have occurred before this policy runs, add an auth policy earlier in the chain.

## Claims in the Generated Token

| Claim | Source |
|---|---|
| `sub` | `AuthContext.Subject` (JWT sub, basic-auth username, API key owner) |
| `iss` | `system.issuer` parameter |
| `iat` | Current time |
| `exp` | Current time + `system.tokenExpiry` |
| `auth_type` | `AuthContext.AuthType` (e.g. `jwt`, `basic`, `apikey`) |
| `original_iss` | `AuthContext.Issuer` — the original token issuer (JWT auth only) |
| `aud` | `AuthContext.Audience` (JWT auth only) |
| `credential_id` | `AuthContext.CredentialID` (OAuth client_id, API key credential) |
| `scope` | `AuthContext.Scopes` as space-delimited string (JWT auth only) |
| _all other claims_ | All non-standard claims from the incoming JWT, forwarded under their original names (JWT auth only — see below) |
| _custom_ | `customClaims` — add new claims or override any of the above |

## Configuration

### System Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `signingKey.inline` | string | — | PEM-encoded RSA or ECDSA private key (mutually exclusive with `path`) |
| `signingKey.path` | string | — | Path to a PEM private key file (mutually exclusive with `inline`) |
| `algorithm` | string | `SHA256withRSA` | Signing algorithm: `SHA256withRSA` (RSA) or `ES256` (ECDSA) or `NONE` (unsigned) |
| `issuer` | string | `""` | Value of the `iss` claim in generated tokens |
| `tokenExpiry` | string | `15m` | Token validity as a Go duration string (e.g. `"15m"`, `"1h"`) |

### User Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `header` | string | `x-jwt-assertion` | Upstream request header to set the generated JWT on |
| `claimMappings` | object | `{}` | Maps upstream JWT claim names to backend JWT claim names (see below) |
| `customClaims` | object | `{}` | Static or dynamic claim name→value pairs added to every generated token (see below) |

## Claim Mappings

`claimMappings` provides a structured way to forward upstream JWT claims into the backend JWT under a different name. The key is the backend JWT claim name to set; the value is the property key from the authenticated context (populated by `jwt-auth` from the upstream JWT's custom claims).

| `claimMappings` key | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| any non-reserved name | `AuthContext.Properties[value]` | String values only |

Claims mapped to reserved names (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`) are skipped with a warning. Missing source properties are silently skipped. `customClaims` entries take precedence over `claimMappings` — if the same destination claim appears in both, `customClaims` wins.

```yaml
claimMappings:
  email: email           # forward AuthContext.Properties["email"] as "email"
  clientRole: role       # forward AuthContext.Properties["role"] as "clientRole"
  orgId: organization    # forward AuthContext.Properties["organization"] as "orgId"
```

## Dynamic Context Claims

`customClaims` values that start with `$ctx:` are resolved from the request context at runtime instead of being treated as static strings.

| Variable | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `$ctx:request.path` | Request path (e.g. `/petstore/v1/pets/42`) |
| `$ctx:request.method` | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, …) |
| `$ctx:request.authority` | Host authority |
| `$ctx:request.scheme` | `http` or `https` |
| `$ctx:request.header.<name>` | First value of request header `<name>` (case-insensitive) |
| `$ctx:api.id` | API UUID |
| `$ctx:api.name` | API name |
| `$ctx:api.version` | API version |
| `$ctx:api.context` | API base context path |
| `$ctx:auth.subject` | Authenticated subject (same value as the `sub` claim) |
| `$ctx:auth.type` | Auth type (`jwt`, `basic`, `apikey`) |
| `$ctx:auth.credential_id` | Credential ID (OAuth client_id or API key) |
| `$ctx:auth.property.<key>` | Custom property from `AuthContext.Properties` |

Context variables that cannot be resolved (missing header, nil auth context, unknown variable name) are **silently skipped** — the claim is omitted from the token rather than causing an error or rejecting the request.

Use this to put an auth context value under a different claim name. For example, to expose the credential ID as `clientId` rather than `credential_id`:

```yaml
customClaims:
  clientId: $ctx:auth.credential_id
```

## Example

```yaml
# System-level (gateway config)
system:
  signingKey:
    path: /etc/certs/backend-jwt.key
  algorithm: SHA256withRSA
  issuer: https://gateway.example.com
  tokenExpiry: 15m

# Per-route policy attachment
policies:
  - name: backend-jwt
    parameters:
      header: x-jwt-assertion
      claimMappings:
        email: email                                 # AuthContext.Properties["email"] → "email"
        clientRole: role                             # AuthContext.Properties["role"] → "clientRole"
      customClaims:
        env: production                              # static
        clientId: $ctx:auth.credential_id            # dynamic — credential ID
        clientName: $ctx:auth.property.client_name  # dynamic — from auth context property
        tenantId: $ctx:request.header.x-tenant-id   # dynamic — from request header
```

The upstream service then validates the `x-jwt-assertion` header using the public key matching the gateway's private key.
